I draw my teaching philosophy from the words of French writer, Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry who wrote, "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea." I am privileged to be involved in physics education which has a long history of great and inspiring teachers. With the inspiration of Euler and Feynman amongst others guiding me, I partake in teaching this ancient subject. The goal of physics is nothing short of complete understanding of the entire universe and everything that it contains. Achieving this audacious goal is what makes physics learning so challenging. Any course in physics comes associated with it new math, new physical insights and translation of the new math into physical insights.  longing can only be achieved by instilling a sense of wonder and fun amongst students. To instill wonder, I believe in giving examples from day-to-day lives who's perspective is enhanced by the knowledge of physics. Another way is to deal with deep philosophical issues. Still another, is to explain weird, counter-intuitive phenomenon. Providing historical context is also helpful. 
It is important to have fun for learning. So, I make sure students feel they're in a nuturing, safe environmnet while learning.
