I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Physics department. I received my undergraduate degree in Physics and Electrical Engineering from BITS Pilani, India in 2017. My research is on using machine learning techniques to understand ultrasonic vocalizations in mice. In my spare time, I like to read about the history of science, play tennis, and go hiking.
