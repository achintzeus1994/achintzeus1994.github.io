I graduated with PhD in Physics from Duke  University. For my PhD, I worked on three projects. In the first project, I  proposed a novel multimodal, identifiable variational autoencoder. In my second project, I created a mathematical model for olfactory memory. In my third project, I used variational autoencoder framework coupled with maximum mean discrepancy analysis to resolve an ongoing debate in neuroscience about difference in ultrasonic vocalization of hearing and deaf mice. I received my undergraduate degree in Physics and Electrical Engineering from BITS Pilani, India in 2017.
